### OpenCL Riemann solver for computational fluid dynamics.

A finite volume solver based on hyperbolic formalisms.

Works in 1D, 2D, and 3D.

Burgers, Roe, HLL, HLLC, Bona-Masso ADM general relativistic solvers in 1D, 2D, 3D
Slope limiter working on Burgers and Roe solvers
Periodic, Mirror, and Free-Flow boundary methods
Self-gravity option for Euler equation solvers

Simulates Euler equations, SRHD, Maxwell, and Bona-Masso ADM formalism

Working on MHD and eventually GRMHD

Might get around to CG or GMRes method of Backward Euler implicit integration

Check out the Makefile for a list of its dependent projects.

### Bona-Masso ADM Numerical Relativity Results:
