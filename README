OpenCL Riemann solver for computational fluid dynamics.
Check out the Makefile for a list of its dependent projects.

Burgers, Roe, HLL solver in 1D, 2D, 3D
slope limiter working on Burgers and Roe solvers
Periodic, Mirror, and Free-Flow boundary methods
Self-gravity option

Working on 1D ADM simulation
Also working on n-D SRHD
Also working on n-D MHD
Should be working on other explicit integration methods like RK3, RK4, and ICN3
Might even get around to Jacobi method of Backward Euler implicit integration
