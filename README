OpenCL Riemann solver for computational fluid dynamics.
Check out the Makefile for a list of its dependent projects.

Burgers, Roe, HLL, HLLC, Bona-Masso ADM solvers in 1D, 2D, 3D
slope limiter working on Burgers and Roe solvers
Periodic, Mirror, and Free-Flow boundary methods
Self-gravity option

Simulates Euler equations, Maxwell, and Bona-Masso ADM formalism

Working on MHD, SRHD

Might get around to CG or GMRes method of Backward Euler implicit integration
