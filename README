OpenCL Riemann solver for computational fluid dynamics.
Check out the Makefile for a list of its dependent projects.

Burgers, Roe, HLL solver in 1D, 2D, 3D
slope limiter working on Burgers and Roe solvers
Periodic, Mirror, and Free-Flow boundary methods
Self-gravity option

Working on 1D ADM simulation
Should be working on other explicit integration methods like RK3, RK4, and ICN3
Might even get around to Jacobi method of Backward Euler implicit integration
