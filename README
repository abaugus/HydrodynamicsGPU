OpenCL Riemann solver for computational fluid dynamics.
Check out the Makefile for a list of its dependent projects.

Burgers, Roe, HLL, HLLC solvers in 1D, 2D, 3D
slope limiter working on Burgers and Roe solvers
Periodic, Mirror, and Free-Flow boundary methods
Self-gravity option

Simulates Euler equations, MHD, Maxwell, and 1D ADM formalism

Working on SRHD

Might get around to Jacobi method of Backward Euler implicit integration
